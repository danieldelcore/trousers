# trousers

`trousers` is the base package which re-exports all necessary functionality from its sub-packages.
Use this package when you want to get up and running quickly or if you don't want to compose your own version of trousers from the sub-packages like `@trousers/core` or `@trousers/theme`.

For API docs, [please see README.md](../README.md#api-reference)
