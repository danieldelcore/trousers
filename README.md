Trousers is a [hooks-first](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) CSS-in-JS library, designed to help developers author React apps with performant and semantic CSS. Trousers encourages semantic organisation of styles without inadvertently increasing the runtime implications often associated with CSS-in-JS libraries.

### Multi-package architecture

Trousers is based on a monorepo architecture, meaning that the internals of the repo have been decomposed into a group of smaller stand-alone packages. Doing this will reduce your bundlesizes and tailor (lol) Trousers to suit your application.

-   `trousers`: Is the base packages which re-exports all of the modules in the sub-packages
-   `@trousers/core`: Holds all of the underlying logic of trousers, including the css collector.
-   `@trousers/macro`: Babel macro that moves 99% of Trousers' runtime logic to build-time
-   `@trousers/react`: React implementation of Trousers
-   `@trousers/styled`: styled-components like API
-   `@trousers/sheet`: Mount styles to CSSStyleSheet API (CSSOM wrapper)
-   `@trousers/hash`: Tiny hashing function
